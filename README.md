# Collaborative-Household-based-Recyclable-Waste-Collection-Management-System
The researchers proposed to develop a community disaster management system with rapid assessment and damage reporting. It is a web-based system that integrates Kobo Toolbox API to collect the data of the household and for the assessments. This system can calculate routes for the mapping of the household to monitor the affected household. The study uses the Waterfall method. With the help of the system, the community can now easily monitor the status of the people that affected by a disaster. The system is built with Php, CSS,HTML and Javascript.

The general objective of this study is to create a collaborative household-based recyclable waste collection management system. Specifically, it aims to:

1. create a registration module that allows a household owner to sell its recyclable waste to the registered
   social enterprise.
2. develop an efficient routing path for collecting social enterprise using OpenStreetMap.
3. create a notification module that will notify both the household owner and social enterprisesâ€™ collector upon pinning to the map by the household owner.
4. provide a QR code to all household owners who make a transaction to the system that will enable the social enterprise's collector to easily fill in the form.
5. to evaluate the system based on ISO 25010 software quality standards.
